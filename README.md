# OOD

This repo consists of all the laboratory tasks I had to write during the Object Oriented Design course at my university. Each task was written during 90 minute Labs.

## Installation
In order to run the code, you need to build it in VS. 

## Tasks

Each task has a txt/pdf/html document inside that specifies in great detail what the task is about. Unfortunately, those are all in Polish.


### 1.  Factory Design Pattern
In this task I had to fill given classes in such a way that Main function of programme would create different objects (user string input) without using IF/switch statement.

### 2. Visitor Design Pattern
In this task I had to fill given classes so that 2 type of Interfaces would work together in different ways depending on what type of (concrete)objects they really were.

### 3. Interpreter Design Pattern
In this task I had to write algorithm that would parse string expression and return value calculated using Revered Polish Notation.
